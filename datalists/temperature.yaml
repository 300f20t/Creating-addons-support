- CORE:
  description: "Defines the entity's internal temperature. This value will rise and fall depending on the ambient temperature."
- BASE:
  description: "A static offset applied to the entity's core temperature. For example, a value of 10 would cause an entity's body temperature to default to 10 when at rest, rather than 0."
- WORLD:
  description: "Defines what the area around the entity feels like. This is unique to each entity and is usually affected by biomes in the vicinity, time of day, nearby blocks, etc."

- HEAT_DAMPENING:
  description: ""
- COLD_DAMPENING:
  description: "Changes the rate at which the entity freezes (decreases in body temperature). Values 0 to 1 slow the speed, with 1 stopping freezing altogether. Negative values speed up freezing."
- FREEZING_POINT:
  description: "Stores the temperature, in Minecraft units, at which the entity will begin freezing to death. "
- BURNING_POINT:
