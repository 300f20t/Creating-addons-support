## Announcements:

 - I'm looking for a person who knows how to make mod elements for a plugin, be my partner. So that you can help me make elements for recipes (for example farmers delight and create). If anyone wants to help me with this and contribute to this big project, you can write in the comments or write to me on Discord. Also, I already know how recipes from mods work, so you will just need to make the mod element.
 - I will only add more support for the Create mod if I have a partner who knows how to make mod elements.
 - What mod support would you like to see in the plugin?
