## Effects and Enchantments description:

#### With Just enought effect descriprion mod you can make effect description and with Enchantments descriprion mod you can make enchantments description. To do than in localization file in localization key write this:

- ##### Just enought effect description - ```effect.mod_ID.effect_ID.description```
